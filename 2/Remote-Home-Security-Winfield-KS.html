Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and how long you prepare to keep recorded footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
