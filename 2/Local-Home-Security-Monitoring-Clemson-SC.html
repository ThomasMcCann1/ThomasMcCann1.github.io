A lot of companies enable clients a 30-day trial period-- but SimpliSafe provides people 60 days, which need to be more than enough time to learn more about the system and ensure it works with your home and your lifestyle. If you do choose to keep the system, it'll be covered by a three-year limited warranty, the longest free warranty among the companies we checked.</p>

If this occurs, call your current monitoring company to validate.
