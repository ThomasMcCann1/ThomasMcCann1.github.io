<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to fix information after the reality, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of taping storage area.
