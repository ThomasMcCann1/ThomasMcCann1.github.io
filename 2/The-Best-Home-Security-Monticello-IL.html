<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
