In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal guard. Several cities also require a license to even own and run a home security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
