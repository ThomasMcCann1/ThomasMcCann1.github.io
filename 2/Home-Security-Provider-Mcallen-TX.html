<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to.

All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
