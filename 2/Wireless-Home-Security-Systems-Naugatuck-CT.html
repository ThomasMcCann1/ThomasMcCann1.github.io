Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial.
