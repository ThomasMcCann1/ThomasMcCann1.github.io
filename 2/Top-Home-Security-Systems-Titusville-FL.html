The rate of false alarms for commercial alarm users may be as much as three times greater than the rate of false alarms among residential alarm users. 9 Persistent incorrect alarm activations are often due to inadequate employee training or inferior systems that have actually not been upgraded.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature.

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
