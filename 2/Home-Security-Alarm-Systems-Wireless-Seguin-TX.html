We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

For example, you can have a clever plug turn on a light inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera detects motion.</p>
