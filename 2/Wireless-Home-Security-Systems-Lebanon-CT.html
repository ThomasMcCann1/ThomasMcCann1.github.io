Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>False Alarms - Enabled 3 (totally free) in a 12-month duration. When it comes to, Wireless cameras present a couple of difficulties configuring them to the network depending on if its commercial or customer grade.
