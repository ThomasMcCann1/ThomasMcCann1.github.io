<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR.

There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
