Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by.
