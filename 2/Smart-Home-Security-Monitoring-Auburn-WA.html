The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
