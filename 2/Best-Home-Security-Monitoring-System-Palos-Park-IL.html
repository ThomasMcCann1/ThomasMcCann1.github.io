<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
