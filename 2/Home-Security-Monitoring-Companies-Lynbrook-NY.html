<p>Piza and associates (2019) carried out a new review of the literature to upgrade a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that took a look at the impacts of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal offense avoidance. The researchers looked for CCTV examinations released between 2007 and 2017 to represent the period since the last evaluation (which covered assessments completed in 2006 and earlier).

Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it adds person detection, which makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, sometimes, fewer incorrect alerts.

(We think this is a better feature if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks frequently pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
