You can even combine multiple cameras together on the app, if you so dream. Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But considering that most retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyway (an employee slipping some additional cash while providing a customer modification, for example), we think it's more important to have top quality images so you have the proof you need.

Lookout is really simply a fantastic name for a kit that includes a Wink smart home center and a few security oriented sensors. You can't deactivate the system and arm. Instead, you turn informs on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or activate the siren.
