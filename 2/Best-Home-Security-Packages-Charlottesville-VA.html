<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a typical camera image. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the reality, which implies that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it likewise brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of taping storage area. So much, in truth, that they need about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is essential.</p>
