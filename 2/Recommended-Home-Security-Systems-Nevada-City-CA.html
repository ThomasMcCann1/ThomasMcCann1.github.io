<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
