However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to appropriately detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, however it may leave you with tape-recording spaces during essential security occasions. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd recommend among our top picks, but the Arlo is terrific for signing in on family and family pets-- or roaming cats sliding around your lawn.</p>
