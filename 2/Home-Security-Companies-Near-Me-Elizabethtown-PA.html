<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
