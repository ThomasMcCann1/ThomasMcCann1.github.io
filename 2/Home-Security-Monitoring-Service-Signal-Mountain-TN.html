<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and an extraordinary worth. It gets an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
