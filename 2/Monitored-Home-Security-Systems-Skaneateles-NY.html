<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to save and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video. The video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
