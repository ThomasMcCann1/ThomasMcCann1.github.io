Whether you're using a wireless IP-based system or subscribe to a security part as a part of a "smart home" plan; these technologies count on user passwords to equip and disarm them. To keep these gadgets secure, it's advised that customers frequently change their passwords and never ever share them with individuals outside the household. Make sure to alter the made password credentials right away upon invoice and replace them with a passphrase that can not be easily thought.

Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
