<p>If you find yourself in this situation, ask your previous alarm company for the installer code to see if they'll supply it to you. If that does not work, you'll need to change the equipment in order to change to a new monitoring company. Outdoor security cameras undoubtedly cost more than their indoor cousins, because-- for beginners-- the need to be protected from the aspects.
