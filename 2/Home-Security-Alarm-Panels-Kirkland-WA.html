<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
