<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet.

<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense.

Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
