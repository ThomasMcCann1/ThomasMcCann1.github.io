The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
