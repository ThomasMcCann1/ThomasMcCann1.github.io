The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.
