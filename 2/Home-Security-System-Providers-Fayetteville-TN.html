<p>Home security systems and modern-day clever home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Try to find a design that provides a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for recorded video. Sometimes it's useful to be able to see what happened right before or after a visitor approaches your door. For that, you'll need a doorbell that utilizes pre-buffering to tape-record the action happening prior to motion is spotted or the doorbell is pressed.</p>
<p>Everyone we handled at NSS were extremely practical and accommodating. The services they offered were exactly what we desired, and they carried out with professionalism and competence. I'm not sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera performs all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially at night when weather actually tinker the night vision. Still, you're right about the Arlo Pro refraining from doing anything to keep rain from striking the lens cover.</p>
