You can even combine several cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But since many retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (an employee slipping some additional money while giving a customer modification, for example), we believe it's more important to have high-quality images so you have the proof you require. Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>Ring Alarm is super cost effective and has good clever home assistance. But do not anticipate very elegant equipment.
