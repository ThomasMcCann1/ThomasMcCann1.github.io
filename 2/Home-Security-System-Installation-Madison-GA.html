<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
