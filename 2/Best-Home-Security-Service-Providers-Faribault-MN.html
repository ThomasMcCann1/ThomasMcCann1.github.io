<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo information as 1080p.
