<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
