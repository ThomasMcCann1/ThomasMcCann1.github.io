<p>You can discover 2 kinds of security systems: professionally monitored and unmonitored. In the former, when an alarm goes off, an expert monitoring company gets a notification and then attempts to contact you and, if need be, your local emergency services.

That indicates you need to be on night, call and day, throughout work and trip time, and all set to figure out whether police, fire departments, or other emergency services need to be dispatched.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level.
