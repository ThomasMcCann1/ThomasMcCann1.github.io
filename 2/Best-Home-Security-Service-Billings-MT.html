<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
