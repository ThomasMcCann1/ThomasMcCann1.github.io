<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR.

There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
