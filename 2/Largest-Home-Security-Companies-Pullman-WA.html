<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

The panel and sensing units are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so altogether a lot.</p>
