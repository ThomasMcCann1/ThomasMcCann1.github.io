<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to authorities capability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed homes) a ineffective and expensive approach to theft reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Like a lot of modern innovation, home security systems have developed and enhanced in time.
