<p>No false alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the police for an incorrect alarm. Considering that the homeowner supervises of the system, authorities are just contacted if there's a genuine emergency. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will call cops if a homeowner can't verify a false alarm. , if cops are contacted for a false alarm, property owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching police unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for false alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
