<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
