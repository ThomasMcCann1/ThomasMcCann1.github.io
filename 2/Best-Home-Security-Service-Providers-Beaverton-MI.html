<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
