<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't featured a free tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest at least $3 each month if you want to save any videos. And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
