Having a large number of visible CCTV cameras in public areas might serve as some level of deterrent, knowing you are being shot, though probably not enjoyed.</p>

I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for example. However, those features come at a relatively high cost: $5 monthly ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.  For each extra camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the preliminary cost.

It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (likewise referred to as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other smart devices and can not be managed from another location.
