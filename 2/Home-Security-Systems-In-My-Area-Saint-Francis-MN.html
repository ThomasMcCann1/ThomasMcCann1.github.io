We've found good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, however you'll find more than 30 brand names readily available. Sometimes you do not have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer only professional installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a DIY alternative. ADT does not have the greatest customer service reputation among the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this approximately the fact that ADT has several million more customers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
