<h3>Digital Home Security in Florida</h3>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

<p>The 2nd wireless function has to do with how your security system interacts with the alarm monitoring station. Older security systems would use a home phone line to dial out" and interact with the alarm monitoring station. However, lots of families no longer use a phone line in their home.
