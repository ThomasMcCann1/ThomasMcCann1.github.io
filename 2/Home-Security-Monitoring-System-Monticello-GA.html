<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

Just another sneaky approach to maintain highly profitable accounts.</p>

The alarm does not consist of a wifi security camera but you can buy a variety of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional extras.
