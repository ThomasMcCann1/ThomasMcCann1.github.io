<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras lower crime. HD CCTV systems are compatible with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable (look at the cable behind the TV that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that means you have standard analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax infrastructure.

The average length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements could span as much as 60 months or 5 years. We would recommend thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system rather if you desire to prevent having to sign a contract.</p>

If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
