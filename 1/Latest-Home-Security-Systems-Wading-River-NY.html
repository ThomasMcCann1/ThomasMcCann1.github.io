With the advent of modern-day innovation you now have smarter and budget friendly home security systems that you can set up all by yourself.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features.
