<p>ADT is everything about premium equipment and dependable monitoring. With 140+ years in business and a user-base of 7 million individuals, ADT is hands-down the biggest home security brand name in the industry. Scout devices are more trendy than many.

It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensing unit, so whenever there's some motion identified, it can send you a push notification in your phone so you can react to it immediately.

Moreover, it does not get triggered by small things. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most advanced motion sensors that get rid of all false alarms and just gets set off when people approach it.</p>
