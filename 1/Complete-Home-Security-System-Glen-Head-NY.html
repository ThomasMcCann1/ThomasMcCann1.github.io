When it identified any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would inform users.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the issue.
