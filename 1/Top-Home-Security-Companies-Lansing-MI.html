Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that may show a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or better. After reading the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they offered; they've partnered with another security company and their starter plan I believe starts at $0 down. The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so overall a great deal.</p>
<p>While it strikes the resolution, we presume there's a little interpolation on its 4K video considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still by far the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
