Hey Rebeca, thanks for this blog. I am so glad that you have discussed about wise home integration Simply last week I was given lot of cameras to install by a homeowner, sadly the owner did not buy cameras suitable with his home automation systems.

This isn't actually a huge deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick to white and black.

Connectivity-wise there's HDMI and VGA for hooking it up to a monitor, and you can likewise download Sansco's XMEye app (offered on iOS and Android) to quickly flick between cameras and hit record.
