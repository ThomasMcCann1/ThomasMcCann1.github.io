This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
