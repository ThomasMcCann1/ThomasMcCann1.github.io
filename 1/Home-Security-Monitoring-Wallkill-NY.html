<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was detected. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
