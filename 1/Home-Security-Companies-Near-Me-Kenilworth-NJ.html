How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
