The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to appropriately find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with taping spaces throughout important security occasions. If home security is your main issue, we 'd advise one of our top picks, but the Arlo is excellent for signing in on family and family pets-- or roaming felines sliding around your lawn.</p>
