After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its pledge of as much as one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have observed some enhancements since the camera's launch, and will continue to update this review and test, as required.</p>
