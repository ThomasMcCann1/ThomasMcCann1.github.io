Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.
