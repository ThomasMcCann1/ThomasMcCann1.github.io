The infrared energy discharged by a things is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of finding small distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based on details about the temperature distinctions.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR.
