<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police capability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and costly approach to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
