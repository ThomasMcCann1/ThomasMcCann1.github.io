<p>Besides resolution, also think about the field of view. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, however not all angles are created equivalent. Depending upon the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a huge variety in terms of the camera's vision cone. You need to think about a camera with a really wide field of view if you want to enjoy a big area. The capability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a fantastic asset also.</p>
<p>PTZ cameras can rapidly pan left to right, tilt up and down, and zoom in on things. With customized pre-programmed capabilities, you can rapidly see areas of interest like your parking area, front entryway, or high-traffic areas.

According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, a single incident of vandalism expenses usually $3,370.

<p>How long does it typically take to turn to your alarm monitoring service? I utilize VOIP today. May transfer to cellular at some time in the future however sticking with dial-up for now. Obviously, you might want to consider acquiring a security camera or more to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 overall) is a little bit more expensive than Frontpoint's many basic bundle for $320 (or $255 with the 20% promotional offer), which does not consist of a camera.</p>
