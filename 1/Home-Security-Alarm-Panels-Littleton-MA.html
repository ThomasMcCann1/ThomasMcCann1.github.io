<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring.
