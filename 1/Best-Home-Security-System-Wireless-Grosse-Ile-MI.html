<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. If a patient is having problem, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is generally open or usually closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and notifies, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on.
