<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
