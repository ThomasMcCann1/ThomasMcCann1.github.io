That being said, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism because of their apparent look. In addition, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but requires several cameras if a user needs to see multiple set views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They include a small lip on the end of the camera that adds weather protection and reduces glare.</p>
