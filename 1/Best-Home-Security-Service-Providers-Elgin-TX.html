<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, spanning a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

Call your existing monitoring company to validate if this happens. Normally, you would be notified of a modification like this by mail or telephone, not by an unannounced go to by a representative from another company.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
