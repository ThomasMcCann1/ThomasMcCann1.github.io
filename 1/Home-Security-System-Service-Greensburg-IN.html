The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image.

We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we might revisit this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud.
