<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
