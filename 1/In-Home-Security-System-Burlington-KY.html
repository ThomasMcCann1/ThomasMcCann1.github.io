<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly shut off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away potential robbers.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.
