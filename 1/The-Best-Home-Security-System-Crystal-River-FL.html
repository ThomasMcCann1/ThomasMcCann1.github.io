For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage usually consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself.

<p>Since the glass real estate does not obstruct, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in capabilities. As well as being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for low-light and infrared considering that the glass real estate does not hinder the lens. With some, it's hard to inform at a glimpse where they have actually been aimed, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their real field of view.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
