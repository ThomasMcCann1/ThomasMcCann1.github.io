SimpliSafe is not fantastic at smart home support. It works with Amazon Alexa, and it offers its own smart door lock, but you can't go installing many third-party devices with your SimpliSafe system.

The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the problem.
