<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
