<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
