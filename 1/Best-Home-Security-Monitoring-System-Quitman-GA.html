<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, usually avoid making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can quickly be set up at various residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security strategies also enable remote control of the system and general home automation.

Flood lights can discourage vandals or scare them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
