<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
