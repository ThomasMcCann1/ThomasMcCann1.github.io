<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

The only outdoor security camera that's currently readily available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is fantastic for watching on visitors and plan deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your lawn susceptible. If you have a big backyard or sheds to safeguard, this system may not be the best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't need a base station-- it connects straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can connect the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web browser.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
