Since the dome case makes it really hard for people to see which direction the camera is pointing, this is. This produces an air of unpredictability for potential burglars or vandals approaching from all directions. , if those circumstances sound like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive provide some flexibility on monitoring agreement length if you buy equipment up front.. Of our top five, SimpliSafe is the most versatile for the contract-averse. Some brands, like Frontpoint, even let you move your equipment to a new home totally free.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
