<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was identified. We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey.
