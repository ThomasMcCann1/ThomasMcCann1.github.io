<p>No incorrect alarm charges: House owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the police for a false alarm. Considering that the house owner is in charge of the system, cops are just contacted if there's a genuine emergency situation. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will get in touch with police if a homeowner can't confirm an incorrect alarm. If  police are called for a false alarm, property owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
