This allows you to have a record of events and can assist aid police in the event of a burglary or vandalism. A closed-circuit is the most common, and when an electric current is continuously running around the border of the home, breaking the circuit - by opening a door or window - cuts off the electrical current.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
