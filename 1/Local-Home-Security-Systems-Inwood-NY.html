<p>This is the best-scoring wise alarm we evaluated. It was incredibly basic to set up, as the elements are pre-paired to the base station, and it fasted to set off when any of the sensing units were activated.

The alarm doesn't include a wifi security camera however you can purchase a variety of various Yale cameras that will work with the alarm as optional additionals. There's no external monitoring option with this alarm.</p>
