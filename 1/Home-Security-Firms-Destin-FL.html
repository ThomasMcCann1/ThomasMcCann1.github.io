Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera consistently detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, in addition to when we made changes in the settings.</p>
