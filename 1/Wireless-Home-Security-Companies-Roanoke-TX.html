The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might review this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud. The wide face of the camera provides you an outstanding visual field, and the image you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to wait to the cloud.) To see that video, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer system.</p>
