Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Amazon's face acknowledgment tool, Rekognition, is amongst the real-time video face recognition items currently being piloted by police departments around the nation, as well as the FBI.
