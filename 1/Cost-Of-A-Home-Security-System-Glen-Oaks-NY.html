<p>It depends upon the size and layout of the home and the monitoring goals. The benefits of cameras are that you can get visual confirmation of any activity occurring inside or outside the home.

The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

<p>For the many part, wireless security equipment is just as visible as you want it to be. Window sensing units are quickly concealed behind blinds or curtains, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to mix into the doorframe. You can conceal a wireless camera much easier than you can one with wires. Wireless is the much better option if you want home security that mixes into your decor and does not draw attention to itself. Wireless systems are also ideal for renters since they do not need opening the wall, and can quickly be taken with you when you transfer to your next place. If you're wanting to increase your apartment's security, or just wish to watch on your place while you're out, consider installing a portable wireless security system.</p>
