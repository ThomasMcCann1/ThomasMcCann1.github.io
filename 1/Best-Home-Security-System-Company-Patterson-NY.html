In our screening, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, and so we may revisit this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera offers you an outstanding field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the much better it gets, the more information you'll utilize to wait to the cloud.)
