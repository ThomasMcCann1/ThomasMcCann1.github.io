<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
