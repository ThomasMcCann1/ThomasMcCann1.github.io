Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month cheaper and been in business 3 years so I'm comfortable giving them a shot. Wish I had looked previously however honestly didnt realize I could save cash till required to look when my dealer folded.</p>
