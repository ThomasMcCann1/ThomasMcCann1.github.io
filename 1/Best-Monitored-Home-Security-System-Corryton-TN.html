As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
