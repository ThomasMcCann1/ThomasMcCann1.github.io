<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again react to the alarm; each response is billed.

In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. Because frequently times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more accurate and less frequent informs.</p>
