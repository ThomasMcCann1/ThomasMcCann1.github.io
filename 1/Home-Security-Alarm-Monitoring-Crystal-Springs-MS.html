The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we may revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
