Some of the more expensive cameras are equipped with humidity and temperature level sensing units and will interact with other connected home gadgets such as thermostats and wise lighting systems. If you wish to save some cash, search for a camera with an SD card slot that enables you to record video when motion or sound is discovered, but keep in mind to save your recordings every now and then prior to they are overwritten.

<p>Outdoor Camera - This weatherproof camera delivers smooth security video with a mix of tough wiring and WiFi. It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action.

We have seen some enhancements since the camera's launch, and will continue to update this review and check, as needed.</p>
