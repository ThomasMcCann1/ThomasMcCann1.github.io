<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
