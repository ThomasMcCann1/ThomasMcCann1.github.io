<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
