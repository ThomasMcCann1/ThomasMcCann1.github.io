However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage space.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
