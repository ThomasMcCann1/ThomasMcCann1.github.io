<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
