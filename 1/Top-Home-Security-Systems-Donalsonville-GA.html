<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and decrease crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we may review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera offers you an excellent field of view, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.)

After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have observed some enhancements since the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and upgrade this review, as needed.</p>
