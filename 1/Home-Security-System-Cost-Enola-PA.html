The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly fee ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it might leave you with recording gaps during crucial security events.
