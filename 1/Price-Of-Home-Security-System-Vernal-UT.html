<p>Discover how to develop, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and lower crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
