Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>We searched for Do It Yourself systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement.

No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>
