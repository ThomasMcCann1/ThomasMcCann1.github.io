<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating unit.
