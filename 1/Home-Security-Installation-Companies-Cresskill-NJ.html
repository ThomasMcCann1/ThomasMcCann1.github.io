<p>Many modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it a lot easier to search archived footage, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from multiple locations. Frequently, the mere presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated burglars. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more identified burglars. They may also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if intruders can not see any security cameras.</p>
