You might even offer directions on how to get into your structure. As recently as ten years earlier, consumers did not have access to technology that let them manage their own home security systems.

Rather, you turn informs on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or trigger the siren.
