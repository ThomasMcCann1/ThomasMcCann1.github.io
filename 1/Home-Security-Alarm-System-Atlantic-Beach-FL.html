<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
