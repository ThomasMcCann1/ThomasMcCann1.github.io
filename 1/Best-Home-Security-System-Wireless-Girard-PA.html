Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. If you commit to a three-year contract, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 monthly. Ring's Protect Plus strategy goes for $10 per month and does not require a contract.</p>
