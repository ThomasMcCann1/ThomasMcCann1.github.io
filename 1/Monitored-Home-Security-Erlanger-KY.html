<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an infraction. When a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
