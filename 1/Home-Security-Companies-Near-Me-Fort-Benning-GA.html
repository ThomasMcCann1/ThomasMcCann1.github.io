When the general public takes photos and videos of suspicious activity, incidents can be acted upon much faster and at a lower cost than relying on publicly-funded legions of CCTVs mounted on walls and poles.</p>
<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
