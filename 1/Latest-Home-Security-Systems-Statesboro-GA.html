<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
