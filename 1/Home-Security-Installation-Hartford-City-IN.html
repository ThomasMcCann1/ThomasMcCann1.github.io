<p>The real factor cameras are generally released is to lower much pettier criminal activities. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have actually not lowered criminal offense. "When the crime and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the basic down trend in offenses and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in certain classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.

Cameras let you do whatever from examine your pets during the day to see what's making sounds outside in the middle of the night.</p>
