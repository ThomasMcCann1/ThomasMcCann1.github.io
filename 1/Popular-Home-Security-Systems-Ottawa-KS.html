As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may find out to be cautious about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers.
