<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
